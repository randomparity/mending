# Regression tests for check-records.sh.
#
# The checker is the only mechanically enforced constraint behind the record convention, so its
# failure mode is the dangerous one: reporting a clean run over nothing. Every rule it
# claims has a case here, and every case asserts the exit status rather than the output,
# because a green exit is exactly what an erasure attempt is trying to obtain.
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repo under a scratch directory, runs the real
# checker against it, and compares the exit status to the expectation. Nothing here
# touches the repository it lives in.
#
# Usage: check-records-test.sh [scratch-dir]
#
# A run builds roughly seven thousand files, and the scratch tree it created is removed when
# every case passes. A red or aborted run keeps it, because those fixtures are the only record
# of what failed. An explicitly supplied scratch-dir is the caller's and is never removed.
#
# Needs bash, git, and POSIX find/sed/awk/grep/sort/uniq/diff/mktemp/date — nothing else.
# No perl, no Python, no GNU-only flags, no bash-4 constructs: an adopter's gate must not go
# red for a missing interpreter. It resolves the workflow template from either the
# publishing layout (beside the scripts) or the adopted one (../workflows/).
#
# It also needs the rest of the gate beside it — the checker, the migrator, and both profiles
# (see REQUIRED_ASSETS). An install that omitted one exits 2 before the first case rather than
# deriving failures from it.

# Hook runners can export repository-local Git variables such as GIT_DIR and
# GIT_WORK_TREE. Clear them before creating fixtures so each `git -C` command
# targets the disposable repository named by the suite.
#
# The list is captured rather than read through a process substitution: that loop reports
# its own status and never rev-parse's, so a git that could not answer would leave the loop
# reading nothing, nothing unset, and every case below building fixtures with the ambient
# GIT_DIR still set — a scan that could not run read as one that found nothing (ADR 0005).
# clear_git_env in scripts/test-fixture-helpers.sh is the same fix at the same call; this
# suite cannot source it, because `just records` compares .github/scripts/ against
# skills/tome-of-lore/assets/ byte for byte and the two sit at different depths, so no one
# relative source path resolves from both.

# Every assertion in this file decides its verdict by scanning a file the run captured or
# wrote, and grep answers three ways: it matched (0), it read the file and found nothing
# (1), or it could not finish reading it (2 or more). `if grep -q ... "$f"` folds the third
# into the second, so a capture the suite could not read scores exactly like one that held
# no such line — and at the second scan in case_why below, that verdict is `pass`, for
# every case in this file. ADR 0005 rules that a scan whose result feeds a verdict captures
# its own exit status and branches three ways, reporting the third through the channel the
# script already fails through. This suite's channel is a FAIL line and the failed counter,
# and these two helpers plus the `case $status in` at every call site are where it obeys.
#
# The capture is written `status=0; grep -q ... || status=$?`: under `set -euo pipefail` a
# bare call aborts the run and a following `; status=$?` never executes, so the `||` that
# assigns rather than branches is the required form, not merely a permitted one.
#
# `cmp -s` is a scan too and converts with the rest: measured on macOS it exits 1 for "the
# files differ" and 2 for a file it could not read, and the migrator cases turn that answer
# straight into a verdict about whether a run wrote to a record — so a fault would arrive
# labelled "wrote despite a dirty worktree", a claim the run never established.
#
# Three shapes elsewhere in this file are deliberately left alone, so the next reader does
# not have to work out which half they are in. A `grep -v ... >"$f"` that transforms a
# fixture decides no verdict, and `set -euo pipefail` already stops the run on either
# non-zero status. A match run over a shell variable rather than a file — `printf '%s\n'
# "$x" | grep -q` — is the in-memory case ADR 0005 names as outside the rule: its failure
# modes are not the scan-could-not-run case. And `[ -e ]`/`[ -s ]` are metadata tests, not
# reads — they answer "is there anything there", which is the question rather than a proxy
# for it. migrator_why is where that distinction matters: absent and empty are different
# answers there, so it asks both rather than letting the first fall into the second.
#
# The list covers the scans that decide a verdict. Everything else that reads a file here —
# the `sed`/`head`/`cat` command substitutions that build a diagnostic — runs after the
# verdict is settled and aborts the run under `set -e` rather than quietly changing one.

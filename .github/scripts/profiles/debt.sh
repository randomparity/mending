# two fields that are specific to a deferral — `target:` and `review-by:`.
#
# Newline-delimited strings rather than arrays: bash 3.2 is the macOS system shell, where
# "${arr[@]}" on an empty array is fatal under `set -u`.
#
# Every value below is read by check-records.sh after it sources this file, never within it;
# linted standalone, shellcheck cannot see that use. SC2154 is the mirror of that blindness:
# read_section_out and read_section_status are assigned by read_section in check-records.sh,
# which sources this file, so a standalone lint sees only the reads.

# Sourced by check-records.sh, never executed. It supplies the record-kind knowledge the engine
# deliberately lacks: which directory, which sections, what a Status means, and the two rules
# that are specific to an ADR — the H1 carries the record's number, and a supersession banner
# names a sibling record by path rather than free text.
#
# Newline-delimited strings rather than arrays: bash 3.2 is the macOS system shell, where
# "${arr[@]}" on an empty array is fatal under `set -u`.
#
# Every value below is read by check-records.sh after it sources this file, never within it;
# linted standalone, shellcheck cannot see that use. SC2154 is the mirror of that blindness:
# read_section_out and read_section_status are assigned by read_section in check-records.sh,
# which sources this file, so a standalone lint sees only the reads.
